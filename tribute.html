      <q>"Shawna had such an exuberant spirit. I see many of you nodding your heads because you know this may be the understatement of the century. 

        Even though I was two years ahead of Shawna in school, people in my class would ask if I was Shawna’s brother. It used to infuriate me, but I understand why it happened. Shawna made a point to learn everyone’s name. Not only that, but she would also learn everyone’s siblings’ names, how long they had lived in the area, and whether they liked chocolate or strawberry ice cream. 
        
        Shawna was a natural-born public relations director. She loved people, and people loved her. It’s no surprise there’s not an empty seat in the church today. This packed house means a lot to my parents and me. We can’t tell you how much we have appreciated all the messages we have received in the last week. Your support has been overwhelming."</q>
